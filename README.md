# VILT Starter Kit

I've created this repository to allow for a quick start at the development of the VILT stack apps.

# Technologies:

- Vue 3
- InertiaJS
- Laravel 10
- TailwindCSS
- Ziggy (So you can call your Laravel routes inside Javascript)
- Laravel Auditing (To keep track of changes in your app Models)
- Laravel Precognition (For live validation of your Frontend)

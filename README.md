# VILT Starter Kit

I've created this repository to allow for a quick start at the development of the VILT stack apps.

It comes with Vue 3, InertiaJS, Laravel 10 and TailwindCSS. Besides that, i've also added Ziggy so you can call your Laravel routes inside Javascript, Laravel Auditing as a log tool and Laravel Precognition for reactive forms validation.
